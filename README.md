## Introduction
Enhancers play a pivotal role in gene expression and can be linked to various diseases when they malfunction. Identifying these enhancers is a significant challenge in computational biology due to their variable characteristics and lack of distinct genomic features.

## Abstract
This project presents a comprehensive approach to enhancer prediction by combining 10 public datasets and constructing a feature matrix using ENCODE ChIP-Seq peak regions. Through a series of steps involving Random Forest classifiers and iterative refinement, we've created a high-quality dataset and developed the DNABERT-Enhancer model. This model, fine-tuned on this dataset, showcases an accuracy of 80.92% in enhancer prediction, demonstrating its effectiveness.

## Datasets
The repository includes the combined dataset of enhancer and non-enhancer sequences used for training and testing the DNABERT-Enhancer model.

### Dataset Details:
- **Enhancer Sequences:** 7,779 sequences
- **Non-Enhancer Sequences:** 8,172 sequences
- **Sequence Length:** 200 bp

## Model
DNABERT-Enhancer is built upon DNABERT, a large language model for the human genome, fine-tuned specifically for enhancer prediction.

### Model Highlights:
- **Training Accuracy:** 80.92%
- **Features:** Top ENCODE features
- **Methodology:** Random Forest classifiers and iterative refinement

## Usage
Instructions on how to use the DNABERT-Enhancer model and datasets for enhancer prediction will be provided here.
